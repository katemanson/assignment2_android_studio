Possible hands, in order of value, are:
- Pontoon — 21 points in two cards (so, an ace and a face card)
- Five Card Trick — five cards totalling 21 or less
- Card value (Aces 1 or 11)
- Bust.

1. Initial deal of two cards each.
2. Player (the user) plays their hand first, followed by the dealer (the app).
3. If either has a hand worth less than 15, they have to twist.
4. If their hand is worth 15 or more they can choose to stick or to twist.
5. A Five Card Trick effectively ends their turn.
6. During play the initial deal remains face down; twist cards are face up.
7. Provided the dealer and the player finish their turns without going bust, they compare hands. If the hands are of equal value, the dealer wins.
