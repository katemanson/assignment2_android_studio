Possible hands, in order of value, are:
- Pontoon — 21 points in two cards (so, an ace and a face card)
- Five Card Trick — five cards totalling 21 or less
- Card value, up to and including 21 (pip value, face cards 10, Aces 1 or 11)
- Hands with a value of more than 21 are bust.

1. Initial deal of two cards each.
2. Player (the user) plays their hand first, followed by the dealer (the app).
3. If either has a hand worth less than 15, they must twist.
4. If their hand is worth 15 or more (but not bust) they can choose either to stick or to twist.
5. A Five Card Trick effectively ends their turn.
6. During play each player's first two cards remain hidden from their opponent, while twist cards are visible.
7. If the dealer and the player finish their turns without going bust, they each show all their cards.
8. If the hands are of equal value, the dealer wins.
